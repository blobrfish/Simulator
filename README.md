# Simulator
This console application: 

1)Prompts the user to enter the width and length of the table followed by the starting position of the moving object in the following format: width,length,x,y
2)Prompts the user to enter the commands for the moving object. Commands are added by comma seperation with "0" as the final command.
3)Outputs the final position of the moving object. The output will be [-1,-1] if the moving object is not positioned within the table.

Important! No data validations has been added to the user input due to time constraints. The system will throw exceptions or act accordingly to the protocol if incorrect data formats are inputted. 

/Thank you
